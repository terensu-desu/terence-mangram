## Author Notes:
Building on what I started with 'asosam4,' I went through old code and structure with a fine-toothed comb. I set out to clean up the structure I used with MaterializeCSS, add more transitions, use best practices with React syntax (followed AirBnB's guide), and use more good ol' Javascript. On top of all that, I added a new page called My Apps which showcases small apps built using React. The Recipe app, for example, utilizes Redux and localStorage throughout, and was really interesting to learn. I plan on adding more features to each of the first four apps, and maybe more apps in time.
